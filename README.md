Take a look at the [Notes](#notes) and [TODOs](#todo).

## Requirments
* SilverStripe 3.0

## Installation
* Download and copy module in SilverStripe root directory and name it whatever you want
* Run dev/build?flush=all to regenerate the manifest
* run ?flush=all in CMS to force the templates to regenerate

## Bulk Image Upload
A component for uploading images in bulk into the managed Model relation, with option to edit fields on the fly.

### Usage 1
Simplest usage, add the component to your GridField as below. The component will find the first Image has_one relation on the managed Model and the record's editable CMS fields
		
		$config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkEditingTools());
		$config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkImageUpload());

### Usage 2
You can specify which Image field to use and which fields are editable from the managed Model
$imageField (string): The name of the image field to use (should have 'ID' at the end: If your relation is set has 'MyImage' => 'Image', the parameter should be 'MyImageID')
$editableFields (array): list of db fields name as string that will be editable like: array('myTextField', 'myVarcharField', 'myEnumField')
		
		$config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkEditingTools());
		$config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkImageUpload( $imageField, $editableFields ));

### Configuration
The component's option can be configurated individually or in bulk through the 'config' functions like this:

    $config->getComponentByType('GridFieldBulkImageUpload')->setConfig( $reference, $value );
		
#### $config overview
The available configuration options are:
* 'imageFieldName' : sets the name of the Image field of the managed Model (i.e. 'MyImageID')
* 'editableFields' : array of string referencing specific CMS fields available for editing
* 'fieldsClassBlacklist' : array of string referencing types (ClassName) of fields that wont be available for editing
* 'fieldsNameBlacklist' : array of string referencing the names of fields that wont be available for editing
* 'folderName' : name of the folder where the images should be uploaded
* 'sequentialUploads' : boolean, if true files will be uploaded one by one
* 'maxFileSize' : integer, maximum upload file size in bytes 

Each option can be set through the component's method setConfig( $reference, $value )
In addition, some configuration option can be set more specifically via individual methods:
* addFieldNameToBlacklist( $fieldName )
* addClassToBlacklist( $className )
* removeFieldNameFromBlacklist( $fieldName )
* removeClassFromBlacklist( $className )

### Sample Files

#### Page Model

		class Page extends SiteTree {

			public static $db = array(
			);

			public static $has_many = array(
					'Visuals' => 'Visual'
			);

			public function getCMSFields() {
				$fields = parent::getCMSFields();

				$config = GridFieldConfig_RelationEditor::create();	
				$config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkEditingTools());
				$config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkImageUpload());		
				$f = new GridField('Visuals', 'Case Study Visuals', $this->Visuals(), $config);
				$fields->addFieldToTab('Root.Visuals', $f);

				return $fields;
			}

		}

#### Visual Model
('Image', 'Type', 'Title' and 'Embed' Fields will be picked up automatically by the component)

		class Visual extends DataObject
		{
			public static $db = array(
					'Type' => "Enum('Image,Embed','Image')",
					'Title' => 'Text',
					'Embed' => 'HTMLText'
			);

			public static $has_one = array(
					'Page' => 'Page',
					'Image' => 'Image'
			);

			public function getCMSFields() {
				$fields = new FieldList();

				$fields->push( new DropdownField(
					'Type',
					'Type of visual',
					singleton('Visual')->dbObject('Type')->enumValues()
				));

				$fields->push( new TextField('Title', 'Title and Caption for images (useful for SEO)') );
				$fields->push( new TextareaField('Embed', 'HTML Embed code') );		

				$f = new UploadField('Image', 'Image file');				
				$fields->push($f);

				return $fields;
			}
		}

## Bulk Manager
A component for Editing, deleting and unlinking records on the fly

### Usage
Add GridFieldBulkEditingTools component if not done already and simply add GridFieldBulkImageUpload
		
		$config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkEditingTools());
		$config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkManager());
		
### Configuration
The component's option can be configurated individually or in bulk through the 'config' functions like this:

    $config->getComponentByType('GridFieldBulkManager')->setConfig( $reference, $value );
		
#### $config overview
The available configuration options are:
* 'editableFields' : array of string referencing specific CMS fields available for editing
* 'fieldsClassBlacklist' : array of string referencing types (ClassName) of fields that wont be available for editing
* 'fieldsNameBlacklist' : array of string referencing the names of fields that wont be available for editing

## Notes
* The HTML form fields for each editable fields are taken from the Model's getCMSFields() method
* This is still pretty experimental and probably needs a bit more in depth testing
* The code could probably be written better and/or cleaned up
* The Components take bit and pieces around from CMSFileAddController, GridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest, UploadField, overrides and adds some behaviors, templates and styles...

## @TODO

### Common bug
* When editing fields, if the last field of the edit form is a drop down or similar, the drop down menu is cropped off
* Some 'minor' things just don't work

### Bulk Image Upload
* Add individual actions for each upload (update + cancel)
* Handle and display errors better for: creation, update, cancel
* Make it work not only for images -> might need to rename this component then? -> should be handled by another component

### Bulk Manager
* Make 'select all' menu prettier
